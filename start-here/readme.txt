You can install the theme through the WordPress installer under "Themes" > "Install themes" by searching for it.
Alternatively you can download the file, unzip it and move the unzipped contents to the "wp-content/themes" folder
of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the theme.

========= Updates =========

Be careful to save your /inc/custom.php file before updating the theme.

========= Instructions =========

Start Here has no extra options because it does not seem necessary.
The only options are those available in the WordPress Customizer:
* Custom layout (left or right sidebar)
* Custom header
* Custom background (colors and images)
* Custom colors (site title, menu, etc...)

Start Here contains two custom widgets:
* A Recent Posts widget with Thumbnails
* A Facebook likebox widget

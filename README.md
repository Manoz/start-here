### Current 'Theme-Sheck' errors

**REQUIRED:** Could not find **wp_link_pages**.
    <?php wp_link_pages( $args ); ?>

> I don't know why this error appears. I have my own function to generate wp_link_pages. I should find why Theme-Check don't want it.

**RECOMMENDED:** No reference to **add_theme_support( "custom-header", $args )** was found in the theme. It is recommended that the theme implement this functionality if using an image for the header.

> I don't want to add this theme_support yet.
